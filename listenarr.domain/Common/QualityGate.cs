        /// Three rules, in order.
        ///
        /// A name match wins outright: the label and a rung name, either of which may be the
        /// broader, so the bare "MP3" a loose parser emits lands on "MP3 320kbps".
        ///
        /// Only when no rung name matches does the codec group decide, which is what lets a profile
        /// refuse a container label like "M4B" that names no rung of its own. Note what that
        /// ordering costs. Once the fallback is reached the gate is working at codec granularity,
        /// and one permitted rung in the group permits the whole group. A profile that refuses
        /// "MP3 VBR" refuses a release labelled exactly that, and permits one labelled "MP3 V0" as
        /// long as some other MP3 rung is permitted. Per-rung refusal only bites on labels the
        /// ladder names.
        ///
        /// The third rule is for a label the gate cannot place at all: no rung names it, and
        /// <see cref="QualityMatcher.CodecGroupOfLabel"/> cannot say what codec it is. Read that
        /// literally, because it is narrower than "unrecognised". "Lossless" is recognised by
        /// ParseQualityLabel, which reports it as lossless with no codec, and a bare bitrate is
        /// recognised as a bitrate with no codec; both have no codec to report and so both land
        /// here. That is
        /// <see cref="QualityGateVerdict.Refused"/>. A ladder is an allow-list, and a label nobody
        /// can map onto it is not on it. The argument for the other reading is that absence is not
        /// refusal, and it is a good argument about a *rung*, but it does not reach this far: the
        /// question here is not whether the operator ticked a box, it is that nothing in the
        /// profile is even about this release. The costs are not symmetric either. A wrongly
        /// refused release is one candidate missing from a list, carrying its reason. A wrongly
        /// permitted one is a grab, and it wins the ranking on the way through, because the labels
        /// in this gap are containers the scorer ranks highly: AAX is 95, second only to FLAC
        /// (SearchResultScorer.GetQualityScore).
        ///
        /// Reachability, stated so nobody has to re-derive it: no parser in this repo emits AAX,
        /// AAXC or MP4 as a quality or a format today, so neither the defect nor the risk of
        /// over-refusing is reachable through a shipped indexer. Both sides of the argument above
        /// are about the contract rather than about an observed grab. The scorer's aax branch is
        /// already there waiting for the first parser that emits one, which is the case this rule
        /// is here to meet.
        ///
        /// Two things this is NOT. It is not new severity. The scorer used to build this allow-list
        /// inline from the Allowed=true rungs and refuse any label that matched none of them, so
        /// every profile carrying a ladder already refused AAX, the stock default included. An
        /// earlier draft of this comment implied otherwise; it was wrong, and dropping the third
        /// rule would have been a loosening rather than a preserved behaviour.
        ///
        /// And it is not the second rule in disguise: a label that IS placed, into a codec group
        /// the ladder happens to carry no rung for, still returns
        /// <see cref="QualityGateVerdict.NoOpinion"/>. That case has to stay silent.
