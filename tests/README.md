### Creating a test

* Test name should be the name of the class you are trying to test followed by `Tests`. Example for `DownloadService`: `DownloadServiceTests`
* Your test class should be in a path mirroring the main project being tested by it (example: `Adaper` tests are in `Features/Api/Services/Adapters`)
* Your test class should inherits `BaseTests`. Example for `DownloadService`: `DownloadServiceTests : BaseTests`
* Your test class should define the following tags:
```
[Trait("Name", "DownloadServiceTests")]
[Trait("Category", "DownloadService")]
```
* You can override `InitializeAsync` to define common setup for all test methods in your test class
* You can override or remove services for dependency injection by calling `Init()` at the start of the test or test setup:
```
Init(services => services.WithSingleton(myMock.Object));
Init(services => services.Without<IServiceToRemove>());
```

* If you need a custom service lifetime, use the matching method in the `Init()` builder
```
Init(services => services.WithScoped<IMyService, MyService>());
```
* Take note of how the initial class was registered as it might not be obvious how some of them should be replaced to make sure the test actually uses it
* You should add data to repositories only after you have called `Init()` with any custom service overrides
* If you did not alter any service, `Init()` is done for you in the test constructor already

The `Init()` method create the following things:
* A `ServiceProvider` using the services you injected and default ones added for you. This provider is accessible using `_provider`
* A reference to the most useful repositories to save you some line of codes:
    * `IDownloadRepository` under `_downloadRepository`
    * `IDownloadClientConfigurationRepository` under `_downloadClientConfigurationRepository`
    * And so on...

Tests cases should be defined using the following steps:
* Given: Initial data/situation
* When: Action to be done/tested
* Then: Assertions to make sure the situation is as expected

### Creating a mock
* API mock should inherits `BaseMocks`
* Any mock inheriting `BaseMocks` has access to:
    * `GetCallCount()` to know how many times the mock was used
    * `GetLastRequest()` to get the latest request processed by the mock
    * `GetLastContent()` to get the latest request body processed by the mock
    * And some other helpful things, check the code for more informations

### Initializing data

* Data should be initialized using the builder pattern
* Each data builder should produce actionable and coherent data (meaning, all mandatory field have plausible value, interdependant fields are populated and so on)

### Dependency Injection (DI)

* Each test class is responsible for defining the mock it wants to use
* Mandatory mocks are the ones that interfaces with external interfaces (search providers, download client adapters through, mostly, http clients, ...)
