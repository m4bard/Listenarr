/// Decides where a companion file belongs relative to an audiobook base path.

/// An import batch can span disjoint trees. Archive extraction puts the archive's contents
/// under a temporary directory and leaves the files the release shipped loose in the download
/// directory, so the batch's common directory climbs to whatever those two have in common.
/// On the stock container layout that is the filesystem root, and relativizing against it
/// hands back each companion's own absolute path with the root stripped off, which no
/// containment check can reject; the source tree is then recreated inside the library folder.
/// On a host where the temporary directory and the download directory share a parent it is
/// that parent, which produces a shorter tree in the same place.
///
/// The batch never had one source structure to reproduce, so this resolver does not look for
/// one. Each extraction directory is its own root, the files that stayed in the download
/// directory share theirs, and a companion is mirrored only under the root it actually came
/// from. A companion that belongs to no root falls back to travelling with the audio file
/// imported out of its own directory, and is refused if there is no such file.
///
/// The manual import path calls <see cref="TryResolveBesideImportedFile"/> directly, because it
/// has no source structure worth reproducing at all: its audio destinations are
/// built from naming patterns and never carry the source's shape, so mirroring a companion's
/// source position gives the sidecar a structure the file it accompanies has just lost. Every
/// companion it sweeps up sits in the directory of a selected file, so the fallback is the whole
/// rule there. Readarr and Sonarr place extras the same way, in the imported file's own folder
/// (<c>src/NzbDrone.Core/Extras/Files/ExtraFileManager.cs</c>, <c>ImportFile</c>, in both).
