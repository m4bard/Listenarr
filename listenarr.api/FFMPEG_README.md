ffprobe requirement
===================

This project uses `ffprobe` (part of the FFmpeg project) to extract audio file metadata (duration, sample rate, bitrate, channels, embedded tags).

Where it comes from
-------------------

ffprobe is a NuGet dependency, `Openur.FFprobeStatic`, the same package Sonarr references. Its version is pinned in `Directory.Packages.props` like every other package. The package carries a static build per runtime identifier under `runtimes/<rid>/native/`, covering linux-x64, linux-arm64, linux-arm, linux-musl-x64, linux-musl-arm64, osx-x64, osx-arm64, win-x64, win-arm64, win-x86, freebsd-x64 and freebsd-arm64.

- A RID-specific publish (`dotnet publish -r linux-x64`, which is how release artifacts and the CI Docker images are built) places the binary next to the application.
- A RID-agnostic build (`dotnet run`, the tests, the root `Dockerfile`) keeps the `runtimes/<rid>/native/` tree, and `FfprobeBinaryLocator` looks there for the current runtime only.

Nothing is downloaded at first boot.

Fallback
--------

If no packaged binary matches the running platform, Listenarr uses `ffprobe` (or `ffprobe.exe`) from the `ffmpeg` directory under its config directory if one has been placed there. A binary that an older release downloaded into that directory is ignored while a packaged one exists.

Permissions
-----------

NuGet does not preserve Unix file modes reliably, so the binary can arrive without execute permission for every user. The Docker images set it during the build (`docker/runtime/finalize-app.sh`), and on startup Listenarr sets it itself when it owns the file.

Licensing
---------

FFmpeg is distributed under the LGPL or GPL depending on how it is built. The packaged linux-x64 build (9.0.2.508) reports `--enable-version3` without `--enable-gpl` in its configuration; the other platforms were not checked. Redistributing it with Listenarr carries FFmpeg's licensing obligations; review https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html.
